# Still-Untitled-Game-1.0

This is the first version of the game I am attempting to build. I started out building the game to run in the IDE console to keep things simple. My goal here was just to get an idea for how to set up a game and learn some basics.

The game can be run by running the MainGame.java file in the consoleVerison package.

This version is no longer being updated due to my transferring it to a GUI version.

There is no story or plot. The only things that can be done in the game are gather potions ingredients and save/load the game to one of three .txt files.

The next version of this game, the GUI version, can be found in the repository Still Untitled 3.0.
